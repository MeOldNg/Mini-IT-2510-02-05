Adam wakes up in the morning.
He brushes his teeth.
He DOES NOT take a bath.
He DOES NOT have breakfast.
Then he checked Instagram.
He DOES NOT go to class.
The lecturer noticed Adam is not in class.
Adam was confused with git.

He likes to fight with his sister for random things that are useless and boring.
